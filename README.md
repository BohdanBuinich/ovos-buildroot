# MycroftOS
MycroftOS is a bare minimal linux OS based on Buildroot to run the Mycroft A.I. software stack on embedded devices. 
The software stack of Mycroft creates a hackable open source voice assistant.

## Focus

- Linux kernel 4.14 (LT)
- Buildroot 2018.08.x
- Raspberry Pi 3B (initial development hardware)

## Getting started

At this moment development is in very early stages and focussed on the Raspberry Pi 3B. As soon as an initial first workable version
is created, other hardware might be added.

Building instructions will follow soon...
